# Origins

A character's Origin conveys their experiences, upbringing and physiology, and how those change how they interact with the world.

Each Origin is defined by a number of [origin talents](#) and [variations](#) that change how a character plays. Origins are built from a [lineage](#Lineages) as a template, which usually allow a number of talents to be selected by the player.

## Origin Talents

Origin talents are constant, selectable options which grant characters abilities based on their background in some way, although they can be developed as well through training or other circumstances. Origin talents are generally considered extraordinary abilities unless specified otherwise.

Origin talents are divided into three categories based on power and use: potent, auxiliary, and utility. Potent and auxiliary talents provide combat-relevant abilities of two separate tiers of power and can be selected only as part of an origin tradition or the Extra Origin Talent feat. Utility talents from origin spheres are designed primarily for out-of-combat use and may be selected in place of other utility talents for classes and progressions which gain utility talents from combat, magic, or skill spheres. Origin talents may never be gained as temporary talents through any means.

### Variations

Not all characters possess the default abilities detailed in an origin traditionâ€™s baseline. Certain characters may possess more limited movement options, elemental vulnerabilities, poor daylight vision, or any number of other distinct challenges the character might face. Variations exist to represent these unique aspects mechanically.

A character may select any number of variations whenever they would be able to gain an origin talent, although certain variations may only be selected at the same time that a character gains a specific origin talent. These variations are in addition to the talents you gain. Variations are cumulative, but a character cannot select a variation which would cause them to lose something they have already lost from another variation (for example, if a character possesses the Buoyant Traveler variation, they possess no land speed and thus may not select the Waterhome variation). Unless otherwise specified, a variation can only be selected once.

At GM discretion, a character may choose to lose or gain any number of variations whenever they level up. In certain cases, it may make sense for characters to seek out special training, or magic in order to remove or gain a variation which alters their character in some way. When a character loses a variation, they also lose any abilities which used that variation (or the abilities gained from it) as a prerequisite.

## Lineages



### Classic Lineages

### Custom Lineages

Some settings have such a great diversity of species and cultures that no set list of lineages can properly convey the setting. This is appropriate for settings where a character's forms are highly personal, such as a space opera where the list of species is countless as the stars or a campaign taking place in a dream world where character's forms are drawn from pure imagination rather than physical lineage.
