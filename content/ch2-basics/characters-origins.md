# Origins

A character's Origin conveys their experiences, upbringing and physiology, and how those change how they interact with the world.

Each Origin is defined by a number of [origin talents](Origins#) and [variations](Origins#) that change how a character plays. Origins are built from a [lineage](Origins#Lineages) as a template, which usually allow a number of talents to be selected by the player.

## Origin Talents

Origin talents are constant, selectable options which grant characters abilities based on their background in some way, although they can be developed as well through training or other circumstances. Origin talents are generally considered extraordinary abilities unless specified otherwise.

Origin talents are divided into three categories based on power and use: potent, auxiliary, and utility. Potent and auxiliary talents provide combat-relevant abilities of two separate tiers of power and can be selected only as part of an origin tradition or the Extra Origin Talent feat. Utility talents from origin spheres are designed primarily for out-of-combat use and may be selected in place of other utility talents for classes and progressions which gain utility talents from combat, magic, or skill spheres. Origin talents may never be gained as temporary talents through any means.

### Variations

Not all characters possess the default abilities detailed in an origin tradition’s baseline. Certain characters may possess more limited movement options, elemental vulnerabilities, poor daylight vision, or any number of other distinct challenges the character might face. Variations exist to represent these unique aspects mechanically.

A character may select any number of variations whenever they would be able to gain an origin talent, although certain variations may only be selected at the same time that a character gains a specific origin talent. These variations are in addition to the talents you gain. Variations are cumulative, but a character cannot select a variation which would cause them to lose something they have already lost from another variation (for example, if a character possesses the Buoyant Traveler variation, they possess no land speed and thus may not select the Waterhome variation). Unless otherwise specified, a variation can only be selected once.

At GM discretion, a character may choose to lose or gain any number of variations whenever they level up. In certain cases, it may make sense for characters to seek out special training, or magic in order to remove or gain a variation which alters their character in some way. When a character loses a variation, they also lose any abilities which used that variation (or the abilities gained from it) as a prerequisite.

### Origin Tags

Origin talents and variations may have the following tags that indicate how and when they may be purchased. If a talent possesses multiple tags, you may decide which applies best to your character. Only the limitations of that tag apply.

* **Acquired:** Acquired traits can be caused by genetic variation, or gained over the course of a character's life due to events such as injury, training or encounters with esoteric forces. Acquired traits (and any talents bought with an acquired variation) are lost when your character is polymorphed.

* **Essence:** Essence traits are innate to a character's magical essence, due to distant ancestory or simply individual nature. Unlike innate traits, they can manifest in characters of any lineage. However, essence traits cannot be purchased after the first level without story justification, subject to GM approval.

* **Innate:** Innate traits are typically a fundamental part of a character's biology or essence that cannot be easily changed. Innate traits cannot be added to an existing lineage without backstory justification, subject to GM approval, nor can they be purchased after the first level without story justification. Innate traits (and any talents bought with an innate variation) are lost when your character is polymorphed.

* **Learned:** Learned traits are skill and talents learned over the course of a character's life, through their culture, training or experience. Learned traits are lost when your character's body is being controlled by another creature (such as due to possession effects, or the effects of the Fusion talent).

#### Optional Rule: Free Development

In some settings (such as those of the Chinese cultivation, or Japanese isekai genres), characters can easily develop their innate traits, changing physically and spiritually as the story progresses. The GM may choose to waive the GM approval requirement for essence traits, innate traits, or both before the game begins.
:::::

## Creature Type

Each creature has a creature type that defines the basic structure of their body and mind. Some abilities improve characters abilities to fight against creatures with certain types, or only work against creatures of certain types.

### Physical Types

Physical types represent what a character is made out of physically, and the shape their body takes. Non-magical poisons or other toxins often only affect creatures of a specific type or group of types.

* **Biological:** Mundane animals and humanoids, with living bodies made out of flesh and blood.
* **Construct:** Animate beings made out of non-living materials animated by magic or technology.
* **Plant:** Animate beings made out of materials that resemble wood, leaves, and vines rather than flesh.
* **Amorphous:** Slimes and similar living beings with biological bodies, but with no form or structure.
* **Elemental:** Creatures made purely out raw manifestations of physical elements.
* **Ephemeral:** Creatures with bodies made out of raw magic, information, or other esoteric elements.
* **Undead:** Formally living creatures whose flesh has been reanimated through magic or technology.
* **Unbodied:** Creatures that cannot exist permanently (or at all) as a material being.

### Mental Types

* **Animal:** Non-sapient creatures driven by emotion and instinct.
* **Machine:** Non-sapient creatures driven by algorithms and logical calculations.
* **Spirit:** Non-sapient creatures bound to singular archetypes or metaphysical principles.
* **Humanoid:** Beings with human-like intelligence, built over animal emotion and instinct. Sapient form of Animals.
* **Algorithmic:** Beings with human-level intelligence born of self-modifying algorithms capable of fuzzy logic. Sapient form of Machines.
* **Fey:** Beings who think and experience the world through stories, archetypes, and esoteric concepts. Sapient form of Spirits.
* **Mindless:** Creatures that react based on principles too simple to be considered considered a true mind.

::::: {.sidebar}
#### Optional Rule: Very Common Types

Some origin talents in this campaign are designed for games where the enemies players are likely to face are diverse, and fall into different creature types. However, in some campaigns, the majority of potential opponents in the world share a type, such as the "Biological" physical type.

In such campaigns, the GM may disallow characters from having abilities that increase their effectiveness against those types, or consider using a custom type list to avoid this problem. Drawbacks that allow abilities to function only against a certain type should never be banned in this way.
:::::

::::: {.sidebar}
#### Optional Rule: Campaign Customizations

The GM may choose to replace the creature type lists with custom ones designed to reflect their campaign. The physical types list may be modified to better suit the kinds of creatures that are common in a setting, or reflect rules of the setting's magic that allows it to be more specific.

The mental types list should be modified only if the setting has a strong reason for it. For example, aligned outsiders in the default Pathfinder setting could have a different mental type due to their minds being strongly tied to cosmic alignment, and the setting of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* would justify adding a separate "Monster > Demon" pairing.

For similar reasons, the GM may choose to ban certain physical or mental types for player characters entirely.
:::::

## Lineages

A character's origin is built using a Lineage as a template. A lineage consists of the following traits:

* **Size:** Adults of a lineage may be of Medium or Small size. Additionally, if your character is particularly young or short for their race, they may be of a Small size even though their lineage is usually Medium.

* **Type:** Characters of a given lineage all have the same physical and mental type. Player characters may not be of the Unbodied physical type without special abilities that allow them to and may only possess sapient mental types.

* **Cosmetic Elements:** Characters of a given lineage may possess any number of cosmetic features that do not have mechanical consenquences. Pointed ears, vibrant fur, non-prehensile tails, and additional fingers on each hand are all examples of features which don’t necessarily need to be reflected through origin talents.

* **Innate Traits:** All characters of a given lineage possess a certain list of talents. These are almost always traits with the innate tag, but may be variations or the benefits they gain from innate variations.

* **Standard Traits:** Most characters of a given lineage possess a certain list of talents. Player characters may choose other talents of the same tier in their place with proper backstory justification and GM approval.

* **Free Talents:** All origins provide a certain number of free origin talents that each character may freely choose. These talents represent a character's personal upbringing and talents, or unusual differences they have from most members of their lineage.

Additionally, all characters have the following traits baseline, which may be modified by origin talents. In premade lineages, these are specified directly rather than in terms of origin talents to simplify character creation:

* **Speed:** The character has a base land speed of 30 feet.

* **Limbs:** The character possesses two arms with opposable thumbs which can wield weapons and other equipment. They also possess two legs which are used for mobility.

::::: {.sidebar}
#### Optional Rule: Uncommon Types

In many settings, being an uncommon creature type is a major advantage - such as being Fey in a world where most mages have mental magic tuned for Humanoids, or being a Construct in a campaign where poisons are commonly used. In such a case, you may require that characters spend an auxiliary origin talent to pick creature types that provide an innate advantage.
:::::

## Selecting Lineages

How lineages are picked or built depends on the campaign setting, and is chosen by the GM before the campaign starts.

### No Lineages

Some settings have such a great diversity of species and cultures that no set list of lineages can properly convey the setting. This is appropriate for settings where a character's forms are highly personal, such as a space opera where the list of species is countless as the stars or a campaign taking place in a dream world where character's forms are drawn from pure imagination rather than ancestry. It is also recommended for settings where there is only a single dominant species, and hence origins reflect solely a character's upbringing.

All characters choose one of the following options:

* They gain two potent origin talents, one auxiliary origin talent, and one utility origin talents.
* They gain one potent origin talent, four auxiliary origin talents, and two utility origin talents.
* They gain six auxiliary origin talents, and four utility origin talents.

Then, they choose their size, type, and appearance freely.

### Setting-based

Some settings have a fixed list of species, cultures, or other similar groupings that player characters are expected to follow. In such settings, the GM should prepare a list of lineages. To create a lineage, choose one of the origin talent loadouts from the [No Lineages](Origins#). Spend any number of these slots to assign innate and standard talents, and list all remaining slots as free talents. Finally, assign the lineage's usual size, creature type, and typical appearances.

For an example set of setting lineages, see the [Classic Lineages](Origins#) section, which has prebuilt lineages for many Pathfinder races.

### Collaborative

As an alternative to [Setting Lineages](Origins#), a GM may allow player characters the option to create their characters without restrictions, then create lineages around them to represent the species or cultures they come from. Under this ruleset, players create their characters as in the [No Lineages](Origins#) ruleset, then picks a list of traits among them to be innate and standard talents for other members of their species.
