## Character Creation

### Step 1: Character Concept {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The first part of character creation is to come up with a rough idea of who you want to play. What is their name, how old are they, and what gender are they? How old are they? What kind of person are they?

Then, think as to their life history. What kind of background do they have? What did they make of it? What skills and talents do they have? Do they use magic, or are they trained to fight with weapons? How has their view of the world and the kind of person they are influence the skills they've developed? How has their history changed who they are?

Once you have a core character concept, consider how to translate it to the mechanics found in Pathfinder and Spheres of Power.

> Some players may prefer to start character creation by starting with the mechanical aspects and moving on backwards to their backstory. If so, it works to skip this step and come back to it after all other steps. In the end, it only matters that all steps get done, not the order in which you do them.

### Step 2: Determine Ability Scores {.unlisted .unnumbered}

*(For details, see: [Ability Scores]())*

Each character has six ability scores that represent their most basic attributes:

* Strength represents your character's muscle and physical power.
* Dexterity represents your character's agility, reflexes and balance.
* Constitution represents your character's health and stamina.
* Intelligence represents how well your character learns and reasons.
* Wisdom represents your character's willpower, common sense, awareness and intuition.
* Charisma represents your character's personality, personal magnetism, ability to lead and appearance.

Start by generating your character’s ability scores. These six scores determine your character’s most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have better than average scores for some of your abilities.

For each of your six ability scores, pick one of the values from the following list, and then add the point values together. The cost must sum to 12 or 13. If you spent only 12 points, add 1 to your lowest 5 ability scores. If you spent all 13, instead add 1 to only your 3 lowest ability scores. If two or more scores are tied, you may choose which to apply it to among the tied scores.

Most of the time, your character's ability scores will not be used directly. Instead, a modifier associated with each ability will be used. To calculate the modifier for an ability, divide it by two and subtract 5. This number is often added to dice rolls or other calculations relating to your character's statistics.
