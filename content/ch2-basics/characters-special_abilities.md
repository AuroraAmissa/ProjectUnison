# Special Abilities

The following special abilities include rules commonly granted or possessed by a number of creatures and talents.

## Blindsight

Some creatures possess blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a non-visual sense (or a combination senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such senses may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can’t see ethereal creatures). This ability operates out to a range specified in the creature description.

Blindsight exists in several variants depending on how precisely it functions. See the [Blindsense](Special Abilities#) section for details on these variants.

## Blindsense

Blindsense lets a creature notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent that cannot be seen has total concealment (50% miss chance) against a creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.

Blindsense exists in several variations depending on how precisely it functions:

* **Echosense/Echosight:** The character detects their environment through the reflection of soundwaves. A character cannot use echosense to distinguish color or visual contrast, meaning that they will not be able to use this sense to perceive any writing or visual images that do not have raised surfaces. Characters can use this sense without being subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target. A character cannot use echosense when they are deafened or in a soundless environment such as the vacuum of space. Echosense requires line of effect to function but can reveal living and nonliving material alike. Echosense and echosight can be foiled by illusions with the Illusory Sound talent.

* **Superior Scent/Scentsight:** The character detects their environment through a keen sense of smell or taste. A character cannot use superior scent to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target. A character cannot use superior scent in an airless environment such as the vacuum of space. Superior scent requires line of effect to function but can reveal living and nonliving material alike. Superior scent or scentsight can be foiled by illusions with the Illusory Odor talent.

* **Thermal Sense/Thermal Sight:** The character detects their environment through thermal discrepancies. A character cannot use thermal sense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target. A character cannot use thermal sense in areas with Heat or Cold of severity 3 or higher (thus having no effect in environments below 40° F or above 90° F). Thermal sense requires line of effect to function but can reveal living targets and nonliving material alike. Thermal sense or thermal sight can be foiled by illusions with the Illusory Touch talent.

* **Tremorsense/Tremorsight:** The character detects their environment through vibrations moving through solid or liquid surfaces. A character cannot use tremorsense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target. A character cannot use tremorsense to detect targets which are not in contact with the same surface or body of liquid as the character. Tremorsense requires line of effect to function but can reveal living targets and nonliving material alike. Tremorsense and tremorsight can be foiled by illusions with the Illusory Touch talent.

## Darkvision

Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black-and-white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.

## Fast Healing

A creature with the fast healing special quality regains hit points at an exceptional rate, usually 1 or more hit points per round, as given in the creature’s entry. Except where noted here, fast healing is just like natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be reattached. Fast healing continues to function (even at negative hit points) until a creature dies, at which point the effects of fast healing end immediately.

## Favored Terrain

Many abilities refer to a "favored terrain", giving you the ability to work more effectively in certain kinds of environment. The list of favored terrains you may pick is as follows: Cold (ice, glaciers, snow, and tundra), Desert, Forest, Jungle, Mountain, Plains, Swamp, Underground (caves and dungeons), Urban, Water (above or below the surface).

Additionally, you may pick the landscape of any alternative plane of existence as a favored terrain.

#### Optional Rule: Additional Terrain Types

Some settings may have a common terrain biome that does not map well to the terrain types here. If so, the GM may choose to add additional favored terrain types. These favored terrain types should usually be known before the game starts.

## Scent

This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

A creature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these ranges.

The creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the scent is a move action. If the creature moves within 5 feet (1 square) of the scent’s source, the creature can pinpoint the area that the source occupies, even if it cannot be seen.

A creature with the Nature skill and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Nature check to find or follow a track. A creature with the scent ability can attempt to follow tracks using Nature untrained. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Nature skill in regard to tracking. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that have the scent ability, however, can use it in the water easily.

False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the ability to properly detect or identify creatures, and the base Nature DC to track becomes 20 rather than 10.

## Spell Resistance

Spell resistance (abbreviated SR) is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells.

To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a magic skill check at least equal to the creature’s spell resistance. The defender’s spell resistance is like an Armor Class against magical attacks. If the caster fails the check, the magical effect doesn’t affect the creature, even if would normally affect the multiple times over several rounds. The possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its spell resistance to operate.

Only magical effects and sphere-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to spell resistance and some that are not.

A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so requires 2 acts and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At the beginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s spell resistance automatically returns unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (a simple action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity).

A creature’s spell resistance never interferes with its own magic, items, or abilities.  Spell resistance does not stack, but rather overlaps.
