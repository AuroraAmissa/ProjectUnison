## Summary

## Axes Weapons List

Axes are weapons consisting of weighed head with a point or edge. They used by chopping or chipping at targets. As they are adapted from tools used to break rock or wood, they are especially proficient at destroying objects and equipment.

::::: {.ability}
###### Battleaxe [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 1 \
**Damage** [1d8]{.c} slashing; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** axes \
**Tags** [breach] 3

*The handle of this axe is long enough that you can wield it one-handed or two-handed. The head may have one blade or two, with blade shapes ranging from half-moons to squared edges like narrower versions of woodcutting axes. The wooden haft may be protected and strengthened with metal bands called langets.*

###### Greataxe [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 1 \
**Damage** [2d6]{.c} slashing; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** axes \
**Tags** [breach] 4

*This two-handed battle axe is heavy enough that you can’t wield it with one hand. The head may have one blade or two, and may be “bearded” (meaning hooked or trailing at the bottom) to increase cleaving power and help pull down enemy shields. The haft is usually 3 to 4 feet long.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Handaxe [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d6]{.c} slashing; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** axes \
**Tags** [breach] 3, [sunder]

*This one-handed axe is short (roughly 1 foot long) and designed for use with one hand. Unlike throwing axes, it is not well balanced for a graceful tumbling motion, and is instead heavier at its head. Tomahawks, war hatchets, and other such names usually refer to hand axes.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Heavy Pick [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d6]{.c} piercing; **Critical** ×4 \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** axes \
**Tags** [breach] 4, [pierce]

*This variant of the light pick has a longer handle and can be used with one or two hands. It is a common, inexpensive weapon for mounted soldiers since it can be used effectively from horseback.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Light Pick [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d4]{.c} piercing; **Critical** ×4 \

**Damage** [1d8]{.c} piercing; **Critical** ×4 \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** axes \
**Tags** [breach] 4, [pierce]

*A two-handed version of the heavy pick, the brutal pickaxe is equally effective at breaking up earth and stone as it is at sundering flesh and bone. Often a weapon of convenience for commoners, the pickaxe is also a favorite among brutes and thugs who value the intimidation factor afforded by the immense weapon.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Throwing Axe [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d6]{.c} slashing; **Critical** ×2 \

## Archery Weapons List

Archery weapons are varied weapons used to fire projectiles at targets from a distance. Unlike firearms, archery weapons are operated entirely by the user's own muscles, and do not rely on any external force to propel their projectiles.

::::: {.ability}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1]{.c} piercing; **Critical** — \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** simple; **Range** ranged (20 ft.) \
**Groups** archery; **Ammunition** blowgun darts

*Blowguns are generally used to deliver debilitating (but rarely fatal) poisons from a distance. They are nearly silent when fired.*

**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** simple; **Range** ranged (80 ft.) \
**Groups** archery; **Ammunition** bolts \
**Tags** [reload] (simple)

*A crossbow is a ranged weapon consisting of a bow-like assembly, mounted horizontally on a main frame, and hand-held in a similar fashion to the stock of a long gun.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Longbow [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 1 \

**Cost** —; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d8]{.c} bludgeoning; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** exotic; **Range** ranged (80 ft.) \
**Groups** archery, thrown; **Ammunition** sling bullets \
**Tags** [concealable], [power]

*A sling is made from a small cradle or pouch in the middle of two retention cords.*

**Effects:** You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a simple action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity, but may be taken as part of the same action as firing a sling if you are proficient with the weapon.

A sling may be loaded with ordinary rocks. Picking up a rock off the ground is a simple action, and using rocks reduces the damage dice of the sling by one step, causes it to only apply half Strength modifier, and causes a -2 penalty to-hit.

**Exotic:** While a sling may be used by a non-proficient user, it only has a range increment of 20 ft. and deals [1d4]{.c} damage for such users, in addition to the usual penalty.

**Utility:** Training in using slings includes the knowledge of how to construct one from easily accessible materials. A character with sling proficiency can make a sling from cordage in 1 hour. They can make a sling from entirely natural materials in the wilderness in 10 hours. They may spend 15 minutes in wilderness to find 10 rocks properly shaped for use as ammunition. 30 such rocks have a bulk of 1. The user suffers no penalty for using these stones as ammunition unlike with ordinary rocks.
:::::

## Heavy Blades List

Heavy blades are weapons with a broader blade, allowing it to strike with more force and be used more effectively in defensive stances.

::::: {.ability}
###### Falchion [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 2; **Bulk** 1 \
**Damage** [1d10]{.c} slashing; **Critical** 18-20/×2 \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** heavy blades \
**Tags** [blocking]

*This sword has one curved, sharp edge like a scimitar, with the back edge unsharpened and either flat or slightly curved. Its weight is greater toward the end, making it better for chopping rather than stabbing.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Longsword [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d8]{.c} slashing; **Critical** 19-20/×2 \
**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** heavy blades \
**Tags** [blocking]

*This sword is about 3½ feet in length.*
:::::

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d6]{.c} slashing; **Critical** 18-20/×2 \
**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** heavy blades \
**Tags** [blocking]

*This curved sword is shorter than a longsword and longer than a shortsword. Only the outer edge is sharp, and the back is flat, giving the blade a triangular cross-section.*
:::::

###### Scythe [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 2 \
**Damage** [1d8]{.c} piercing and slashing; **Critical** ×4 \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** heavy blades \
**Tags** [fearsome], [trip]

*This weapon consists of a long wooden shaft with protruding handles and a sharp curved blade set at a right angle. Derived from a farm tool used to mow down crops, a scythe requires two hands to use, and is unwieldy but capable of inflicting grievous wounds. Its connotations as a symbol of death make it an intimidating weapon.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Spiked Chain [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d10]{.c} piercing; **Critical** ×2 \

**Groups** heavy blades, flails \
**Tags** [blocking], [disarm], [trip], [finesse]

*This 4-foot-long length of chain is covered with barbs and has spikes on one or both ends. Some feature metal hoops used as handgrips.*

:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Greatsword [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** heavy blades \
**Tags** [blocking]

*This larger, bulkier version of the common club is heavy enough that you can’t wield it with one hand. It may be ornate and carved, reinforced with metal, or a simple branch from a tree. Like simple clubs, greatclubs have many names, such as cudgels, bludgeons, shillelaghs, and more.*
:::::

## Light Blades List

Light blades are weapons with a more lightweight blade, allowing them to be used for quick and precise strikes.

::::: {.ability}

**Damage** [1d6]{.c} piercing; **Critical** ×2 \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** simple; **Range** melee \
**Groups** light blade

*Bayonets are close combat weapons designed to fit into special grooves on crossbows and firearms.*

**Effect:** Bayonets may be attached to a two-handed crossbow or firearm, allowing them to be used in close combat as a melee weapon.
:::::

::::: {.ability}

**Category** light; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** light blades \
**Tags** [agile], [distracting], [precision]

:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Shortsword [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d6]{.c} piercing and slashing; **Critical** 19-20/×2 \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** light blades \
**Tags** [agile], [blocking]

*Shortswords are some of the most common weapons found in any martial society, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on the region and creator. Most are around 2 feet in length. Their blades can be curved or straight, single- or double-edged, and wide or narrow. Hilts may be ornate or simple, with crossguards, basket hilts, or no guard at all. Such weapons are often used on their own, but can also be paired as a matched set, or used in conjunction with a dagger or longer sword.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Sickle [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d6]{.c} slashing; **Critical** ×2 \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** simple; **Range** melee \
**Groups** light blade \
**Tags** [trip]

*A sickle is a single-handed agricultural tool designed with curved blades. Like other farming tools, the sickle is often used as an improvised bladed weapon.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Spring Blade [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d4]{.c} piercing or slashing; **Critical** 19-20/×2 \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** simple; **Range** thrown (10 ft.) \
**Groups** light blade \
**Tags** [concealable] +4

*This 4-inch blade is attached via a hinge to a wooden handle with a slot in the center, into which the blade can be folded. With a click of a switch, a spring thrusts the blade outward, where it locks into place until it is reset.*

**Effect:** Releasing the blade is a free action, and resetting it is a simple action. The handle must be in your hand for the blade to be released; placing it in your hand requires the same type of action as drawing a weapon. A spring blade is easy to conceal: an observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the blade hidden within the wooden handle
:::::

## Blunt Weapons List

Blunt weapons are those that deal damage through sheer mass and blunt force. They are especially proficient at dealing damage through heavy armor.

::::: {.ability}
###### Earth Breaker [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 3; **Bulk** 3 \
**Damage** [3d6]{.c} bludgeoning; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** exotic; **Range** melee \
**Groups** blunt \
**Tags** [breach] 5, [crush] 3, [fearsome], [overpower]

*The crude metal of this massive hammer’s head ends in multiple blunt spikes that help concentrate the force of a powerful swing down into a smaller, more focused area, allowing it to smash through armor with greater ease. Due to the tremendous size and weight of its head, an earth breaker is poorly balanced, and requires two hands to properly lift and control.*

**Effect:** Attacking with this weapon requires two acts, and may never be done as a reaction or reduced beyond this value. You suffer a -3 penality to hit versus characters benefiting from a dodge bonus for wearing no armor. The AC reduction from overpower applies even against tower shields.

**Exotic:** An Earth Breaker cannot be effectively used by a character with less than 14 strength, nor a character that does not have proficiency in it. Such characters cannot make attack actions when attempting to wield one.
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Greatclub [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** blunt \
**Tags** [crush], [fearsome]

*This larger, bulkier version of the common club is heavy enough that you can’t wield it with one hand. It may be ornate and carved, reinforced with metal, or a simple branch from a tree. Like simple clubs, greatclubs have many names, such as cudgels, bludgeons, shillelaghs, and more.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}

**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** simple; **Range** melee \
**Groups** blunt \
**Tags** [double]

*A quarterstaff is a simple piece of wood, about 5 feet in length.*
:::::

###### Warhammer [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 1 \
**Damage** [1d8]{.c} bludgeoning; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** blunt \
**Tags** [overpower]

*This weapon consists of a wooden haft and a heavy, metal head. The head may be single (like a carpenter’s hammer) or double (like a sledgehammer). The haft is long enough that you may wield it one- or two-handed. Though heavy and relatively slow to wield, warhammers are capable of delivering immense blows, crushing armor and flesh alike.*
:::::

## Combat Weapons List

Close Combat weapons are weapons that are adapted for use with unarmed martial arts.

::::: {.ability}
###### Axe-Gauntlet [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 1 \
**Damage** [1d8]{.c} slashing; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** exotic; **Range** melee \
**Groups** close combat, axes \
**Tags** [brawling], [blocking], [disarm], [sunder]

*An axe-gauntlet is a locked gauntlet covering the hand and forearm up to and over the elbow, with an axe blade built around the gauntlet’s permanently closed fist.*

**Effect:** An axe-gauntlet takes a full-round action to don, and it gives you a +10 bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts. You can’t use the hand on which an axe-gauntlet is worn for anything else.
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Brass Knuckles [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Damage** [1d3]{.c} bludgeoning; **Critical** 19-20/×2 \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** simple; **Range** melee \
**Groups** close combat \
**Tags** [brawling]

*These close combat weapons are designed to fit comfortably around the knuckles, narrowing the contact area and therefore magnifying the amount of force delivered by a punch.*

**Category** light; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** close combat, light blades \
**Tags** [brawling], [blocking]

*This weapon consists of a soft wrapping around a hard, dense core, typically a leather sheath around a lead rod. The head is wider than the handle and designed to spread out the force of the blow, making it less likely to draw blood or break bones.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Claw Blades [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 2; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d4]{.c} bludgeoning and slashing; **Critical** 18-20/×2 \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** close combat \
**Tags** [brawling], [agile]

*These subtle blades were first created by catfolk, fitting over their claws in one hand to enhance their striking power. Bought in a set of five, they fit over the wearer’s claws on one hand. Versions attached to gloves were later created to allow other races to use their martial arts.*

**Effect:** If your character naturally possesses retractable claws, this item additionally has the "concealable (+4)" property and is treated as an simple weapon.
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Sap [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d6]{.c} bludgeoning; **Critical** ×2 \

:::::

## Flails List

Flails are weapons with a flexible component, whether they're entirely flexible or consist of multiple parts attached by a chain. They may be used to tangle opponent's weapons and disorient them.

::::: {.ability}
###### Bladed Scarf [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d3]{.c} slashing; **Critical** 19-20/×2 \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** exotic; **Range** melee \
**Groups** flails \
**Tags** [agile], [distracting], [finesse], [trip], [precision]

*The thin metal plates interwoven throughout this long scarf turn a fashion accessory into a deadly weapon.*

**Effect:** If you are proficient with this weapon, you may use Arts in place of Acrobatics to move through threatened squares and other creatures. When you successfully move through a creature's square without provoking an attack of opportunity, as an reaction, you may make a melee attack against them with your bladed scarf, attempt to trip them, or attempt to feint them. You may only do this once per creature each round.

Furthermore, you deal 1d6 points of slashing damage to any creature that makes a grapple check against you while you wield the scarf.

**Exotic:** A bladed scarf cannot be used effectively without proficiency in the weapon and the Dance competency in Arts. For characters without this training, they take 1d6 damage each time they attack with a bladed scarf, and suffer double the usual non-proficiency penalty.
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Heavy Flail [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 1 \

**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** flail \
**Tags** [disarm], [trip]

*A light flail consists of a weighted striking end connected to a handle by a sturdy chain. Though often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like the head of a morningstar, the head of a light flail can actually take many different shapes, such as short bars. Military flails are sturdier evolutions of agricultural flails, which are used for threshing – beating stacks of grains to separate the useful grains from their husks.*
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Nunchaku [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.u}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \

**Groups** flails \
**Tags** [agile], [disarm], [nonlethal], [trip]

*A whip is a firm stick designed for direct contact, or a flexible line requiring a specialized swing.*

**Effect:** The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, and threatens all squares within your natural reach. Unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).

As a standard action, you may use your whip to manipulate an unattended object up to 15 ft. away as if you were adjacent to it. You are limited to manipulations you could accomplish in a single move action using only one hand.
:::::

## Polearms List
