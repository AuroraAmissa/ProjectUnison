# Modern Settings
[[Project Unison]() > [Gameplay]() > [Optional Rules]() > $]{.breadcrumbs}

The rules of Project Unison are specifically designed to function in modern urban fantasy settings in addition to medieval settings. Science-fiction or science-fantasy settings are not directly supported, but a further extension to this set of optional rules with Starfinder mechanics will likely be sufficient.

## Resources

In urban fantasy, income is rarely the limiting factor in the equipment your character can obtain, and instead legality or ease of access for truly effective weapons and armor is more important. As such, resources is treated as more of a background trait than a significantly important mechanical focus.

### Resource Levels

The potential income disparity is greater in the modern day due to the larger scale of civilization.

The purchase cap of a resource level represents a character's pocket money and the maintenance cap their total wealth. For lower-class characters, much of their income is tied up into costs of living, and for upper-class characters, much of their wealth is tied up in illiquid assets.

| Resources Level        | Purchase Cap | Maintenance Cap |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 0 (Abject Poverty)     | â€”            | L               |
| 1 (Poverty)            | L            | 1               |
| 2 (Lower Class)        | 1            | 5               |
| 3 (Lower-Middle Class) | 5            | 25              |
| 4 (Upper-Middle Class) | 15           | 120             |
| 5 (Lower-Upper Class)  | 60           | 600             |
| 6 (Upper Class)        | 200          | 3000            |
| 7 (Millionaire)        | 600          | 15000           |
| 8 (National Elite)     | 1200         | 80000           |
| 9 (World Elite)        | 2400         | 400000          |

### Modified Bonus Traits

The Resources bonus trait, and Poverty drawback are modified in modern settings.

###### Resources [Bonus Trait]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}
**Cost:** 1/level \

Your character has a day job which they may rely on for income between their adventures, or a significant source of passive income such as ownership of a business, investments, or a trust fund. Increase your character's base resource level by their levels in this trait.

Levels of this trait beyond the 3rd may only be taken at character creation.

*(**Note:** Characters without this trait have a base resource level of 1.)*

::::: {.ability}
###### Abject Poverty [Character Drawback]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Your character begins with no resource level, and can never gain the Resources drawback or talents that grant them income streams. They may still gain an income through other means.
