# Conditions
[[Project Unison]() > [Gameplay]() > $]{.breadcrumbs}

Characters may often gain temporary conditions during combat or exploration, representing various forms of temporary harm inflicted upon them. If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.

## Conditions List

#### Broken

Items that have taken damage in excess of half their total hit points gain the broken condition, meaning they are less effective at their designated task. The broken condition has the following effects, depending upon the item.

* If the item is a weapon, any attacks made with the item suffer a –3 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Such weapons only score a critical hit on a natural 20 and only deal ×2 damage on a confirmed critical hit.
* If the item is a suit of armor or a shield, the bonus it grants to AC is halved, rounding down. Broken armor doubles its armor check penalty on skills.
* If the item is a tool needed for a skill, any skill check made with the item takes a –2 penalty.
* If the item is a wand or staff, it uses up twice as many charges when used.
* If the item does not fit into any of these categories, the broken condition has no effect on its use.

#### Encumbered

While encumbered, you reduce each of your movement speeds by 10 feet, reduce your maximum Dexterity bonus to AC to +2, and take a -5 penalty to Strength- and Dexterity-based checks.

#### Overburdened

If you have the overburdened condition, you reduce each of your movement speeds to 5 feet, reduce your maximum Dexterity bonus to AC to +0, and take a -5 penalty to Strength- and Dexterity-based checks.
