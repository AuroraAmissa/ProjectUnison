# Introduction
[[Project Unison]() > $]{.breadcrumbs}

Project Unison is an alternative SRD for [Pathfinder] and [Spheres of Power] that reworks the systems of both to simplify the systems of both for newer players while retaining the combat depth that more advanced players enjoy.

[Pathfinder]: https://paizo.com/pathfinder
[Spheres of Power]: http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/

I started it after repeated problems with my players having option paralysis in my Spheres of Powers games, and in general already loathing to check SRDs like d20pfsrd or Archive of Nethys due to the absolute information overload of feats.

Project Unision is designed with the following design goals:

* Unify Spheres of Power and Pathfinder base rules, so that it no longer feels so much like a bolted-on addon.
* Reduce the jank present in Pathfinder and Spheres of Power, and replace poorly designed systems with ones that achieve roughly similar balance, but are simpler and easier to understand.
* Simplify the options available to players by cutting redundant and ineffective feats and talents.
* Increase the options available to players by buffing inefficient feats and talents.
* Do not reduce the complexity of Pathfinder in games with more optimized player builds.
* Decrease the extreme gap between the most optimized builds and less optimized builds. I do not mind one existing, but it is too wide in Pathfinder and Spheres of Power. Spheres of Power already does some of this work, and the house rules here are intended to do the rest.
* Be a single unified SRD that feels like playing Pathfinder with only the core book, but more interesting options and character flexibility available, embrace Spheres of Power's design philosophy.

I made this more for my players, and am releasing it because I think it will help way more people than just me.
