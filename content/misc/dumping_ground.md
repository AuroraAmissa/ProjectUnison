## blah 3

Thrifty Tailoring [SoG]

When creating a disguise, you create it in the least time possible, reducing the normal 1d3 × 10 minutes of work to 10 minutes. This also applies to any other variable-based timing when creating a disguise. You reduce the Disguise penalty for applying a disguise faster by 4 (total).

## Alignment-related traits

Parallel Alignment [potent] (Su)

Your essence possesses a moral component distinct from your own values, such as having a lingering possession on the soul or body, a magical mark from past allegiances, or other influence on the way you are noticed by the universe. Choose an alignment (this alignment does not need to match your own). Magic which reveals alignment reveals this alignment in place of your own alignment. In addition, you can use abilities with descriptors and effects matching this parallel alignment (such as spells with the evil descriptor or sphere effects which you could not normally apply to your own alignment) without affecting your own alignment. You may not select True Neutral as your parallel alignment.

---

Aligned Armaments [auxiliary] (Su)

Any natural weapons and weapons you wield count as being aligned in a manner identical to your alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. For example, if you are lawful good, any weapon you wield counts as lawful and good. You gain subtypes corresponding to the alignments you may count your weapons as (for example, if you are chaotic evil, you gain the chaotic and evil subtypes).

Outside Contacts [auxiliary]

Choose a single creature type or subtype. You must choose a subtype of humanoid or outsider if you select those types. When you summon this type of creature using (summoning) effects, your caster level is treated as 2 higher for the purpose of determining the effect’s duration. Whenever bargaining for the services of a called creature of the chosen type or subtype, you gain a 25% discount on the required payment for any services.

---

Spiny [auxiliary]

You grow spines, thorns, or spikes that may be treated as armor spikes of their size (damage 1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, critical 20/x2, damage type piercing) but may be enhanced as natural weapons. If you take this talent a second time, these spikes are treated as one size larger and may be wielded as a secondary natural weapon if beneficial (allowing you to use them as part of a full attack).
