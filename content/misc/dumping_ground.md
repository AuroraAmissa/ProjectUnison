## Alignment-related traits

Parallel Alignment [potent] (Su)

Your essence possesses a moral component distinct from your own values, such as having a lingering possession on the soul or body, a magical mark from past allegiances, or other influence on the way you are noticed by the universe. Choose an alignment (this alignment does not need to match your own). Magic which reveals alignment reveals this alignment in place of your own alignment. In addition, you can use abilities with descriptors and effects matching this parallel alignment (such as spells with the evil descriptor or sphere effects which you could not normally apply to your own alignment) without affecting your own alignment. You may not select True Neutral as your parallel alignment.
