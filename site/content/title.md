## What is this?

Project Unison is an alternative SRD for [Pathfinder] and [Spheres of Power] that reworks the systems of both to simplify the systems of both for newer players while retaining the combat depth that more advanced players enjoy.

It adds some custom content from the following sources, in addition to Pathfinder and Spheres of Power:

* [Elephant in the Room](https://michaeliantorno.com/feat-taxes-in-pathfinder/)

[Pathfinder]: https://paizo.com/pathfinder
[Spheres of Power]: http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/

## Getting Started

For players who are already familiar with Pathfinder, see the [Major Changes] page for a summary of the most important changes between Pathfinder or Spheres of Power and the systems used here.

## Allowed Content

Any Pathfinder content not explicitly included in this SRD is *not* allowed when using Project Unison without explicit GM permission, and GMs are encourged to do so only with extreme caution. This SRD is in part meant to simplify character creation in Spheres of Power by removing outdated options and consolidating weak ones. Allowing additional content without good reason may seriously impact this.

As a rule of thumb: Additional content introduced to help with a character concept should be allowed. Additional content added to optimize a character further should not be allowed. Most excluded content is done so purposefully.
