### Ability Scores

Each character has six ability scores that represent their most basic attributes - their raw talent and prowess. While a character rarely rolls a check using just an ability score, these scores and the modifiers they create affect nearly every aspect of a character's skills and abilities. An average ability score is 10, and player characters typically start with ability scores ranging from 5 to 18.

#### Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier associated with. To calculate the modifier for an ability, divide it by two, and subtract 5. The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren’t die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.

#### Generating Ability Scores

When you create your character, assign values from the table below to each ability score your character has. The point cost of the ability scores must sum to 12 or 13. If you spent 12 points, add 1 to your lowest 5 ability scores, and if you spent 13, add 1 to your lowest 3 ability scores. If two or more scores are tied, you may choose which score among them to apply the bonus to.

| Ability Score | Points    |
|---------------|-----------|
| 4             | -3 points |
| 6             | -2 points |
| 8             | -1 points |
| 10            | 0 points  |
| 12            | 1 points  |
| 14            | 2 points  |
| 16            | 4 points  |
| 18            | 6 points  |
| 20            | 10 points |
| 22            | 14 points |

## The Abilities

Each ability partially describes your character and affects some of their actions.

### Strength (Str)

Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or "melee") combat. Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character can carry.

A character with a Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is unconscious. Some creatures (such as incorporeal creatures) do not possess a Strength score and have no modifier at all to Strength-based skills or checks.

You apply your character’s Strength modifier to:

* Melee attack rolls.
* Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon, including a sling.
* Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).

**Temporary Bonuses:** Temporary increases to your Strength score give you a bonus on Strength-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The bonus also applies to your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Small or larger) and to your Combat Maneuver Defense.

**Permanent Bonuses:** Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage:** Damage to your Strength score causes you to take penalties on Strength-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The Ability Damage penalty also applies to your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Small or larger) and your Combat Maneuver Defense. See Ability Score Damage below.

### Dexterity (Dex)

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is important for characters who use ranged weapons, light weapons like daggers or rapiers, and for characters who wear light armor or no armor at all. A character with a Dexterity score of 0 is incapable of moving and is effectively immobile (but not unconscious).

You apply your character’s Dexterity modifier to:

* Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and many magical attacks.
* Attacks made with light melee weapons, such as rapiers or daggers.
* Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.
* Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.

**Temporary Bonuses:** Temporary increases to your Dexterity score give you a bonus on Dexterity-based skill checks, Ranged attack rolls, initiative checks, and Reflex saving throws. The bonus also applies to your Armor Class, your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Tiny or smaller), and your Combat Maneuver Defense.

**Permanent Bonuses:** Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage:** Damage to your Dexterity score causes you to take penalties on Dexterity-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, initiative checks, and Reflex saving throws. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to your Armor Class, your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Tiny or smaller), and to your Combat Maneuver Defense. See Ability Score Damage below.

### Constitution (Con)

Constitution represents your character’s health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character’s hit points, so the ability is important for all classes. Some creatures, such as undead and constructs, do not have a Constitution score. Their modifier is +0 for any Constitution-based checks. A character with a Constitution score of 0 is dead.

You apply your character’s Constitution modifier to:

* Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1—that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time they advance in level).
* Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison, disease, and similar threats.

If a character’s Constitution score changes enough to alter their Constitution modifier, the character’s hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.

**Temporary Bonuses:** Temporary increases to your Constitution score give you a bonus on your Fortitude saving throws. In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by this bonus and add that amount to your current and total hit points. When the bonus ends, remove this total from your current and total hit points.

**Permanent Bonuses:** Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage:** Damage to your Constitution score causes you to take penalties on your Fortitude saving throws. In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by the Ability Damage penalty and subtract that amount from your current and total hit points. Lost hit points are restored when the damage to your Constitution is healed. See Ability Score Damage below.

### Intelligence (Int)

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for characters who use skills extensively, and characters who use it to cast magic. Creatures of animal-level instinct have Intelligence scores of 1 or 2. Any creature capable of understanding speech has a score of at least 3. A character with an Intelligence score of 0 is comatose. Some creatures do not possess an Intelligence score. Their modifier is +0 for any Intelligence-based skills or checks.

You apply your character’s Intelligence modifier to:

* The number of bonus languages your character knows at the start of the game. These are in addition to any starting racial languages and Common. If you have a penalty, you can still read and speak your racial languages unless your Intelligence is lower than 3.
* The number of skill points gained each level, though your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.
* The number of spell points you gain each day and the effectiveness of your magical talents, if you use Intelligence as your casting ability modifier.

**Temporary Bonuses:** Temporary increases to your Intelligence score give you a bonus on Intelligence-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any magic DCs based on Intelligence.

**Permanent Bonuses:** Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage:** Damage to your Intelligence score causes you to take penalties on Intelligence-based skill checks. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to any magical effect DCs based on Intelligence. See Ability Score Damage below.

### Wisdom (Wis)

Wisdom describes a character’s willpower, common sense, awareness, and intuition. Wisdom is the most important ability for characters who use it to cast magic. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score. A character with a Wisdom score of 0 is incapable of rational thought and is unconscious.

You apply your character’s Wisdom modifier to:

* Will saving throws (for negating the effects of Mind sphere and other similar effects).
* The number of spell points you gain each day and the effectiveness of your magical talents, if you use Wisdom as your casting ability modifier.

**Temporary Bonuses:** Temporary increases to your Wisdom score give you a bonus on Wisdom-based skill checks and Will saving throws. This bonus also applies to any magic DCs based on Wisdom.

**Permanent Bonuses:** Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage:** Damage to your Wisdom score causes you to take penalties on Wisdom-based skill checks and Will saving throws. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to any magic DCs based on Wisdom. See Ability Score Damage below.

### Charisma (Cha)

Charisma measures a character’s personality, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and appearance. It is the most important ability for characters who use it to cast magic. For undead creatures, Charisma is a measure of their unnatural "lifeforce." Every creature has a Charisma score. A character with a Charisma score of 0 is not able to exert themselves in any way and is unconscious.

You apply your character’s Charisma modifier to:

* Checks that represent attempts to influence others.
* The number of spell points you gain each day and the effectiveness of your magical talents, if you use Charisma as your casting ability modifier.

**Temporary Bonuses:** Temporary increases to your Charisma score give you a bonus on Charisma-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any magic DCs based on Charisma.

**Permanent Bonuses:** Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

**Ability Damage:** Damage to your Charisma score causes you to take penalties on Charisma-based skill checks. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to any magic DCs based on Charisma and the DC to resist your channeled energy. See Ability Score Damage below.

## Changes to Ability Scores

Some abilities increase your ability scores. Ability score increases with a duration of 1 day or less give only temporary bonuses. For every two points of increase to a single ability, apply a +1 bonus to the skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability.

### $$ Permanent Bonuses

Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

### $$ Ability Score Damage

Diseases, poisons, spells, and other abilities can all deal damage directly to your ability scores. This damage does not actually reduce an ability, but it does apply a penalty to the skills and statistics that are based on that ability.

For every 2 points of damage you take to a single ability, apply a –1 penalty to skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability. If the amount of ability damage you have taken equals or exceeds your ability score, you immediately fall unconscious until the damage is less than your ability score. The only exception to this is your Constitution score. If the damage to your Constitution is equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you die. Unless otherwise noted, damage to your ability scores is healed at the rate of 1 per day to each ability score that has been damaged. Ability damage can be healed through the use of spells, such as lesser restoration.

### $$ Ability Score Penalties

Some spells and abilities cause you to take an ability penalty for a limited amount of time. While in effect, these penalties function just like ability damage, but they cannot cause you to fall unconscious or die. In essence, penalties cannot decrease your ability score to less than 1.

### $$ Ability Drain

Ability drain actually reduces the relevant ability score. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to lose skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. Ability drain can be healed through the use of talents such as the Restore Spirit talent of the Life sphere.

## Alignment

This game assumes good and evil are definitive things. Evidence for this outlook can be found in the indicated good or evil monster subtypes, spells that detect good and evil, and spells that have the good or evil descriptor. Characters using spells with the evil descriptor should consider themselves to be committing minor acts of evil, though using spells to create undead is an even more grievous act of evil that requires atonement. Creatures with an evil subtype (generally outsiders) are creatures that are fundamentally evil: devils, daemons, and demons, for instance. Their redemption is rare, if it is even possible. They are evil to their very core, and commit evil acts perpetually and persistently. Mortals with an evil alignment, however, are different from these beings. In fact, having an evil alignment alone does not make one a super-villain or even require one to be thwarted or killed. The extent of a character’s evil alignment might be a lesser evil, like selfishness, greed, or extreme vanity. Having these qualities might not even cause the character to detect as evil when subjected to detect evil, as creatures possessing 4 or fewer Hit Dice do not register to the spell (with the exception of clerics or other characters that radiate an aura).

A creature’s general moral and personal attitudes are represented by its alignment: lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil.

Alignment is a tool for developing your character’s identity—it is not a straitjacket for restricting your character. Each alignment represents a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies, so two characters of the same alignment can still be quite different from each other. In addition, few people are completely consistent.

All creatures have an alignment and alignment determines the effectiveness of some spells and magic items.

Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral. Even deadly vipers and tigers that eat people are neutral because they lack the capacity for morally right or wrong behavior. Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited, but they do not have the moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.

### Good vs Evil

Good characters and creatures protect innocent life. Evil characters and creatures debase or destroy innocent life, whether for fun or profit.

* **Good**: Good implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal sacrifices to help others.

* **Evil**: Evil implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master.

* **Neutral**: People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent, but may lack the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others.

### Law vs Chaos

Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their duties. Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if they feel like it.

* **Law**: Law implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include closed-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, self-righteousness, and a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness say that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can depend on each other and make the right decisions in full confidence that others will act as they should.

* **Chaos**: Chaos implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the downside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote chaotic behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows people to express themselves fully and lets society benefit from the potential that its individuals have within them.

* **Neutral**: Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has some respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor a compulsion to rebel. They are generally honest, but can be tempted into lying or deceiving others.

### Alignment Steps

Occasionally the rules refer to "steps" when dealing with alignment. In this case, "steps" refers to the number of alignment shifts between the two alignments, as shown on the following diagram. Note that diagonal "steps" count as two steps. For example, a lawful neutral character is one step away from a lawful good alignment, and three steps away from a chaotic evil alignment. A cleric's alignment must be within one step of the alignment of their deity.

|             | Lawful         | Neutral      | Chaotic         |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Good**    | Lawful Good    | Neutral Good | Chaotic Good    | 
| **Neutral** | Lawful Neutral | Neutral      | Chaotic Neutral | 
| **Evil**    | Lawful Evil    | Neutral Evil | Chaotic Evil    |
