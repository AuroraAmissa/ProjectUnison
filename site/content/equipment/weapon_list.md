**Effect:** Releasing the blade is a free action, and resetting it is a simple action. The handle must be in your hand for the blade to be released; placing it in your hand requires the same type of action as drawing a weapon. A spring blade is easy to conceal: an observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the blade hidden within the wooden handle

###### Sling [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** —; **Bulk** L \
**Damage** [1d8]{.c} bludgeoning; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** exotic; **Range** ranged (80 ft.) \
**Groups** thrown; **Ammunition** sling bullets \
**Special** concealable, power

*A sling is made from a small cradle or pouch in the middle of two retention cords.*

**Effects:** You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a simple action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity, but may be taken as part of the same action as firing a sling if you are proficient with the weapon.

A sling may be loaded with ordinary rocks. Picking up a rock off the ground is a simple action, and using rocks reduces the damage dice of the sling by one step, causes it to only apply half Strength modifier, and causes a -2 penalty to-hit.

**Exotic:** While a sling may be used by a non-proficient user, it only has a range increment of 20 ft. and deals [1d4]{.c} damage for such users, in addition to the usual penalty.

**Utility:** Training in using slings includes the knowledge of how to construct one from easily accessible materials. A character with sling proficiency can make a sling from cordage in 1 hour. They can make a sling from entirely natural materials in the wilderness in 10 hours. They may spend 15 minutes in wilderness to find 10 rocks properly shaped for use as ammunition. 30 such rocks have a bulk of 1. The user suffers no penalty for using these stones as ammunition unlike with ordinary rocks.

###### Light Flail [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \

*A light flail consists of a weighted striking end connected to a handle by a sturdy chain. Though often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like the head of a morningstar, the head of a light flail can actually take many different shapes, such as short bars. Military flails are sturdier evolutions of agricultural flails, which are used for threshing – beating stacks of grains to separate the useful grains from their husks.*

###### Earth Breaker [Equipment - Weapon]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 3; **Bulk** 3 \
**Damage** [3d6]{.c} bludgeoning; **Critical** ×3 \
**Category** two-handed; **Proficiency** exotic; **Range** melee \
**Groups** blunt \
**Special** breach 5, crush 3, fearsome, overpower

*The crude metal of this massive hammer’s head ends in multiple blunt spikes that help concentrate the force of a powerful swing down into a smaller, more focused area, allowing it to smash through armor with greater ease. Due to the tremendous size and weight of its head, an earth breaker is poorly balanced, and requires two hands to properly lift and control.*

**Effect:** Attacking with this weapon requires two acts, and may never be done as a reaction or reduced beyond this value. You suffer a -3 penality to hit versus characters benefiting from a dodge bonus for wearing no armor. The AC reduction from overpower applies even against tower shields.

**Exotic:** An Earth Breaker cannot be effectively used by a character with less than 14 strength, nor a character that does not have proficiency in it. Such characters cannot make attack actions when attempting to wield one.

**Category** light; **Proficiency** martial; **Range** melee \
**Groups** axes \
**Special** breach 4, pierce

*A two-handed version of the heavy pick, the brutal pickaxe is equally effective at breaking up earth and stone as it is at sundering flesh and bone. Often a weapon of convenience for commoners, the pickaxe is also a favorite among brutes and thugs who value the intimidation factor afforded by the immense weapon.*
