## Light Armor Descriptions

::::: {.ability}
###### Padded Armor [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L; **Weight** Light \
**Armor Bonus** +1; **Max Dex Bonus** +8; **Armor Check Penalty** 0

More than simple clothing, padded armor combines heavy, quilted cloth and layers of densely packed stuffing to create a cheap and basic protection. It is typically worn by those not intending to face lethal combat or those who wish their maneuverability to be impacted as little as possible.

::::: {.ability}
###### Leather Armor [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** 1; **Weight** Light \
**Armor Bonus** +2; **Max Dex Bonus** +6; **Armor Check Penalty** 0

Leather armor is made up of multiple overlapping pieces of leather, boiled to increase their natural toughness and then deliberately stitched together. Although not as sturdy as metal armor, the flexibility it allows wearers makes it among the most widely used types of armor.

###### Studded Leather Armor [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** 1; **Weight** Light \
**Armor Bonus** +3; **Max Dex Bonus** +5; **Armor Check Penalty** -1

An improved form of leather armor, studded leather armor is covered with dozens of metal protuberances. While these rounded studs offer little defense individually, in the numbers they are arrayed in upon such armor, they help catch lethal edges and channel them away from vital spots. The rigidity caused by the additional metal does, however, result in less mobility than is afforded by a suit of normal leather armor.

###### Leaf Armor [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 5; **Bulk** L; **Weight** Light \
**Armor Bonus** +3; **Max Dex Bonus** +6; **Armor Check Penalty** 0

Using alchemical compounds, elves or druidic orders treat special leaves for use in crafting armor. These leaves are stitched together in an overlapping pattern to create a leathery armor as strong and deflective as metal counterparts. Leaf armor jerkins, bracers, and leggings have been made through this process.

###### Chain Shirt [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 1; **Weight** Light \
**Armor Bonus** +4; **Max Dex Bonus** +3; **Armor Check Penalty** -2

Covering the torso, this shirt is made up of thousands of interlocking metal rings.

## Medium Armor Descriptions

::::: {.ability}
###### Hide Armor [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** 2; **Weight** Medium \
**Armor Bonus** +4; **Max Dex Bonus** +4; **Armor Check Penalty** -3

Hide armor is made from the tanned skin of particularly thick-hided beasts, stitched with either multiple overlapping layers of crude leather or exterior pieces of leather stuffed with padding or fur. Damage to the armor is typically repaired by restitching gashes or adding new pieces of hide, giving the most heavily used suits a distinctively patchwork quality.
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Scale Mail [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 3; **Weight** Medium \
**Armor Bonus** +5; **Max Dex Bonus** +3; **Armor Check Penalty** -4

Scale mail is made up of dozens of small, overlapping metal plates. Similar to both splint mail and banded mail, scalemail has a flexible arrangement of scales in an attempt to avoid hindering the wearer’s mobility, but at the expense of omitting additional protective layers of armor. A suit of scale mail includes gauntlets.
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Chainmail [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 2; **Bulk** 3; **Weight** Medium \
**Armor Bonus** +6; **Max Dex Bonus** +2; **Armor Check Penalty** -4

Unlike a chain shirt, which covers only the chest, chainmail protects the wearer with a complete mesh of chain links that cover the torso and arms, and extends below the waist. Multiple interconnected pieces offer additional protection over vital areas. The suit includes gauntlets.

###### Agile Breastplate [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 5; **Bulk** 2; **Weight** Medium \
**Armor Bonus** +6; **Max Dex Bonus** +3; **Armor Check Penalty** -4

A breastplate protects a wearer’s torso with a single piece of sculpted metal, similar to the core piece of a suit of full plate. Despite its sturdiness, its inflexibility and open back make it inferior to complete suits of metal armor, but still an improvement over most non-metal armors.

This breastplate is specially crafted in a manner that allows extra maneuverability for some physical activities. The armor check penalty for Climb checks and Acrobatics checks made to jump is only –1.

## Heavy Armor Descriptions

::::: {.ability}
###### Banded Mail [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 3; **Bulk** 4; **Weight** Heavy \
**Armor Bonus** +7; **Max Dex Bonus** —; **Armor Check Penalty** -6

Banded mail is made up of overlapping strips of metal, fastened to a sturdy backing of leather and chain. The size of the metal plates, interconnected metal bands, and layers of underlying armor make it a more significant defense than similar armors, like scale mail or splint mail.
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Half Plate [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 5; **Bulk** 5; **Weight** Heavy \
**Armor Bonus** +8; **Max Dex Bonus** —; **Armor Check Penalty** -7

Half-plate armor combines elements of full plate and chainmail, incorporating several sizable plates of sculpted metal with an underlying mesh of chain links. While this suit protects vital areas with several layers of armor, it is not sculpted to a single individual’s frame, reducing its wearer’s mobility even more than a suit of full plate. Half-plate armor includes gauntlets and a helm.
:::::

::::: {.ability}
###### Full Plate [Equipment - Armor]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 8; **Bulk** 6; **Weight** Heavy \
**Armor Bonus** +8; **Max Dex Bonus** —; **Armor Check Penalty** -8

This metal suit comprises multiple pieces of interconnected and overlaying metal plates, incorporating the benefits of numerous types of lesser armor. A complete suit of full plate (or platemail, as it is often called) includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith.

## Shield Descriptions

::::: {.ability}
###### Buckler [Equipment - Shield]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Armor Bonus** +1; **Max Dex Bonus** —; **Armor Check Penalty** -1

A buckler is a small shield, gripped in the fist with a central handle behind the boss. Its size makes it poor protection against missile weapons but useful in deflecting the blow of an opponent's weapons, binding their arms, hindering their movements, or punching them.

As a buckler is strapped to an arm, and the hand is considered free for use for other purposes, including wielding a weapon. You take a –1 penalty to attack rolls with any weapon wielded in a hand you have a buckler on. If you use a weapon wielded in your off-hand or provide a spell's somatic components with it, you lose the buckler's Armor Class bonus until your next turn.

###### Light Shield [Equipment - Shield]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** L \
**Armor Bonus** +1; **Max Dex Bonus** —; **Armor Check Penalty** -1 \
**Damage** 1d2 (small), 1d3 (medium); **Critical** x2; **Type** bludgeoning \
**Category** light; **Proficiency** martial; **Weapon Groups** close

A light shield functions the same as a [Shield](Armor List#Shield Equipment Shield), but has differing stats.

::::: {.ability}
###### Shield [Equipment - Shield]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** L; **Bulk** 1 \
**Armor Bonus** +2; **Max Dex Bonus** —; **Armor Check Penalty** -2 \
**Damage** 1d3 (small), 1d4 (medium); **Critical** x2; **Type** bludgeoning
**Category** one-handed; **Proficiency** martial; **Weapon Groups** close

A shield is a piece of personal armour held in the hand, which may or may not be strapped to the wrist or forearm. Shields are used to intercept specific attacks, whether from close-ranged weaponry or projectiles such as arrows, by means of active blocks, as well as to provide passive protection by closing one or more lines of engagement during combat. 

Shields are held in a specific hand like a weapon, and must be wielded to provide their benefits. You can bash an opponent with a shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. Used this way, a shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next turn.

###### Tower Shield [Equipment - Shield]{.ability-head} {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Cost** 1; **Bulk** 3 \
**Armor Bonus** +4; **Max Dex Bonus** +2; **Armor Check Penalty** -10

In most situations, a tower shield provides the indicated shield bonus to your Armor Class. As a standard action, however, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn. When using a tower shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not pass through this edge. The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding.

When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a –2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield’s encumbrance.
