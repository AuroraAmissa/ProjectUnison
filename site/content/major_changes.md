# Major Changes

This is a brief listing of all changes to the Pathfinder core system and Spheres of Power, to help people familiar with the system get acquainted easier with this homebrew SRD.

## Templating Differences

* Actions characters can take are explicitly put into a distinct box, rather than leaving it ambiguous. Sphere effects explicitly modify specific actions rather than leaving some subtle interactions ambigious.
* Dice rolls and calculations are always surrounded in brackets like so: [d20], [d20+10], [2 + 3/character level]. This helps players immediately understand the effect.
* The term "level" is never used ambigiously to refer to "class level". The Project Unison SRD always explicitly uses "class level" or "character level" - or otherwise makes it clear which is being referred to.
* The term "magical effect" is used in place of "sphere effect" and "caster" in place of "spherescaster" as there are no spells in this SRD. To prevent confusion when using external content including spells, the term "spell" and "spellcaster" is never used.

## New Systems

* A new Bonus Points system is introduced, replacing gold, magic items, ability score increases, many feats, and a lot of other miscellaneous things. It in general replaces all systems that give you "more X"

## Pathfinder Core Changes

* Ability scores are generated using a different point buy system. Racial or origin ability scores do not exist.
* Races do not exist, and Origins are always used instead.
* Traits do not exist, and are merged into Origins.
* Favored Class Bonuses no longer exist.
* All characters gain an additional hit dice at first level. Hit dice always use a first maximum + rest average rounded up calculation. Even monsters. They need it in with SoP earlygame.
* Several optional rules sets are in use:
  * Unchained Action Economy
  * Fractional Base Bonuses
  * Elephant in the Room (3PP)
* Gold is not tracked directly. Instead, the backgrounds system is used to track your character's general level of wealth.
* Characters do not gain ability points each 4th level. Instead, this is rolled into the Bonus Points system. 
* Magic items do not exist in the same way as in Pathfinder. Instead, rules are in place that give similar benefits as innate character traits. When using the Project Unison changeset, any magical rewards for dungeons or similar explorations should be at least as powerful as a minor artifact.

## Spheres of Power
