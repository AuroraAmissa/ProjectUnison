# Major Changes

This is a brief listing of all changes to the Pathfinder core system, to help people familiar with the system get acquainted easier with this homebrew SRD.

## Pathfinder Core Changes

* Ability scores are generated using a different point buy system. Racial or origin ability scores do not exist.
* Races do not exist, and Origins are always used instead.
* Traits do not exist, and are merged into Origins.
* Favored Class Bonuses no longer exist.
* All characters gain an additional hit dice at first level. Hit dice always use a first maximum + rest average rounded up calculation. Even monsters. They need it in with SoP earlygame.
* Several optional rules sets are in use:
  * Unchained Action Economy
  * Fractional Base Bonuses
  * Elephant in the Room (3PP)

## Spheres of Power

* The term "magical effect" is used in place of "sphere effect" and "caster" in place of "spherescaster" as there are no spells in this SRD. To prevent confusion when using external content including spells, the term "spell" and "spellcaster" is never used.
