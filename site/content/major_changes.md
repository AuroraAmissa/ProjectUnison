# Major Changes

This is a brief listing of all changes to the Pathfinder core system, to help people familiar with the system get acquainted easier with this homebrew SRD.

## New Systems

* A new Bonus Points system is introduced, replacing gold, magic items, ability score increases, many feats, and a lot of other miscellaneous things. It in general replaces all systems that give you "more X"

## Pathfinder Core Changes

* Ability scores are generated using a different point buy system. Racial or origin ability scores do not exist.
* Races do not exist, and Origins are always used instead.
* Traits do not exist, and are merged into Origins.
* Favored Class Bonuses no longer exist.
* All characters gain an additional hit dice at first level. Hit dice always use a first maximum + rest average rounded up calculation. Even monsters. They need it in with SoP earlygame.
* Several optional rules sets are in use:
  * Unchained Action Economy
  * Fractional Base Bonuses
  * Elephant in the Room (3PP)
* Gold is not tracked directly. Instead, the backgrounds system is used to track your character's general level of wealth.
* Characters do not gain ability points each 4th level. Instead, this is rolled into the Bonus Points system. 
* Magic items do not exist in the same way as in Pathfinder. Instead, rules are in place that give similar benefits as innate character traits. When using the Project Unison changeset, any magical rewards for dungeons or similar explorations should be at least as powerful as a minor artifact.

## Spheres of Power

* The term "magical effect" is used in place of "sphere effect" and "caster" in place of "spherescaster" as there are no spells in this SRD. To prevent confusion when using external content including spells, the term "spell" and "spellcaster" is never used.
