## How to Create a Character

## Ability Scores

Each character has six ability scores that represent their character’s most basic attributes. They are their raw talent and prowess. While a character rarely rolls a check using just an ability score, these scores, and the modifiers they create, affect nearly every aspect of a character’s skills and abilities. Each ability score generally ranges from 3 to 18, although racial bonuses and penalties can alter this; an average ability score is 10.

### Generating Ability Scores

Each character receives a number of points to spend on increasing 

At character creation, assign ability scores from the following list to your 6 ability scores. The point total of your attributes must be 12 or 13. Afterwards, if you spent 13 points, add 1 to your lowest 3 ability scores (you may choose from among your lowest attributes if there is a tie), or your 5 lowest ability scores if you spent 12 points.

At character creation,

4 (-3 points)
6 (-2 points)
8 (-1 points)
10 (0 points)
12 (1 point)
14 (2 points)
16 (4 points)
18 (6 points)
20 (10 points)
22 (14 points)
