# Changes from Pathfinder

This is a brief listing of all changes to the Pathfinder core system and Spheres of Power, to help people familiar with the system get acquainted easier with this homebrew SRD.

## Templating Differences

* Actions characters can take are explicitly put into a distinct box, rather than leaving it ambiguous. Sphere effects explicitly modify specific actions rather than leaving some subtle interactions ambigious.
* Dice rolls and calculations are always surrounded in brackets like so: [d20]{.calc}, [d20 + 10]{.calc}, [2 + 3/character level]{.calc}. This helps players immediately understand the templating..
* The term "level" is never used ambigiously to refer to "class level". The Project Unison SRD always explicitly uses "class level" or "character level" - or otherwise makes it clear which is being referred to.
* The term "magical effect" is used in place of "sphere effect" and "caster" in place of "spherescaster" as there are no spells in this SRD. To prevent confusion when using external content including spells, the term "spell" and "spellcaster" is never used.

## New Systems

* A new Bonus Points system is introduced, replacing gold, magic items, ability score increases, many feats, and a lot of other miscellaneous things. It in general replaces all systems that give you "more X".
* An optional Integrity system is introduced, as a reworked version of Madnesses from Horror Adventures with more generally applicable flavor.

## Pathfinder Core Changes

* Ability scores are generated using a different point buy system. Racial or origin ability scores do not exist.
* Races do not exist, and Origins are always used instead.
* Traits do not exist, and are merged into Origins and Bonus Points.
* Favored Class Bonuses no longer exist.
* All characters gain an additional hit dice at first level. Hit dice always use a first maximum + rest average rounded up calculation. Even monsters. They need it in with SoP earlygame.
* Several optional rules sets are in use:
  * Unchained Action Economy
  * Fractional Base Bonuses
  * Elephant in the Room (3PP)
  * Psychological Combat (3PP)
* Gold is not tracked directly. Instead, the Resources bonus trait is used to gain mundane equipment and consumable items. Resources are no longer equivalent to experience in any form, and may instead be modified as approprate to the storyline without significant impact to balance.
* Characters do not gain ability points each 4th level. Instead, this is rolled into the Bonus Points system. 
* Magic items do not exist in the same way as in Pathfinder. Instead, rules are in place that give similar benefits as innate character traits. When using the Project Unison changeset, any magical rewards for dungeons or similar explorations should be at least as powerful as a minor artifact.
* Alignment is downgraded to an optional rule, and suggestions are given for adapting it to broader settings than standard D&D cosmology.
* Skills are condensed into a smaller set of skills, with an additional Competency system that replicates the old system of trained-only skills.
* Unarmored characters and characters who wear heavy armor now gain special bonuses:
  * Unarmored characters gain a weakened version of the Unarmored Training talent through base mechanics. They gain a dodge bonus to AC that does not stack with armor bonuses, and is lost when they lose their dex bonus to AC.
  * Characters using heavy armor do not suffer a dexterity penalty to AC.
* The weapons list and list of weapon special properties has been significantly reworked. The goal is to make different weapon options distinct
* Weapon proficiency is reworked. All characters are proficient in simple weapons, and characters do not typically gain proficiency in all martial weapons. Instead, as part of a martial tradition, they may gain proficiency with groups of weapons. Proficiency with a single exotic weapon in a group you are already proficient in may be taken in place of a group.
  * Exotic weapons are massively buffed and many features that are part of their feat chains are rolled into having the proficiency due to the increased cost to gain proficiency at all.
* Project Unison uses the Pathfinder 2e system for Bulk for both item costs and item weight.
  * Unlike the Pathfinder 2e implementation L bulk rounds up! That is, if you have only two items with a bulk of L, your total bulk is 1 not 0. This is done to work better for consistency with cost mechanics.

## Spheres of Power

* Sphere-specific drawbacks are no longer considered part of a tradition, and instead simply something you take as part of gaining a sphere.
* Trade and Martial traditions no longer exist as a concept. Instead, as with casting, you simply get two talents for free when you first gain a class with martial or trade talent progression.
* All classes grant 1/2 caster level progression if you have the casting class feature. This is identical to the effects of the Advanced Magic Training feat.
* The competent vs adroit trade tradition distinction is removed. All trade traditions are adroit now.
