## Resources

### Resource Levels

In modern settings, the potential income disparity is greater due to the larger scale of civilization. The purchase cap represents your character's pocket money and the maintenance cap their total wealth.

For lower-class characters, the purchase cap represents what they are able to freely spend after costs of living, and for upper-class characters, it tends to represent the amount of money the can freely draw from liquid assets.
