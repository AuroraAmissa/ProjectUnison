## Character Traits

This section contains  a summary of traits that all characters have, and how they function. For more details, check the subpages for each trait.

### Ability Scores

*(For details, see: [Ability Scores])*

Each character has six ability scores that represent their most basic attributes:

* Strength represents your character's muscle and physical power.
* Dexterity represents your character's agility, reflexes and balance.
* Constitution represents your character's health and stamina.
* Intelligence represents how well your character learns and reasons.
* Wisdom represents your character's willpower, common sense, awareness and intuition.
* Charisma represents your character's personality, personal magnetism, ability to lead and appearance.

#### Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier associated with. To calculate the modifier for an ability, divide it by two, and subtract 5. The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that arenâ€™t die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.

#### Generating Ability Scores

When you create your character, assign values from the table below to each ability score your character has. The point cost of the ability scores must sum to 12 or 13. If you spent 12 points, add 1 to your lowest 5 ability scores, and if you spent 13, add 1 to your lowest 3 ability scores. If two or more scores are tied, you may choose which score among them to apply the bonus to.

| Ability Score |    Points |

| 4             | -3 points |
| 6             | -2 points |
| 8             | -1 points |
| 10            |  0 points |
| 12            |  1 points |
