## What is this?

Project Unison is an alternative SRD for [Pathfinder] and [Spheres of Power] that reworks the systems of both to simplify the systems of both for newer players while retaining the combat depth that more advanced players enjoy. It adds some custom content from the following sources, in addition to Pathfinder and Spheres of Power:

* [Elephant in the Room](https://michaeliantorno.com/feat-taxes-in-pathfinder/)

If you enjoy this SRD, consider buying some of the rulebooks or campaign settings from [Paizo] or [Drop Dead Studios]. Campaign settings, especially, may be used easily with this alternative rules set, and make creating memorable and deep campaigns far easier for GMs.
