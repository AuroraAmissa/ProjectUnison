# Armor and Shields

For most, armor is the simplest way to protect oneself in a world of rampant threats and dangers. Many characters can wear only the simplest of armors, and only some can use shields. To wear heavier armor effectively, a character must possess the approprate Equipment sphere talents.

## Mechanics

### Armor Type

Armor comes in three types: Light, Medium and Heavy. Characters gain special bonuses depending on whether they're wearing armor and what kinds of armor they are wearing: 

* **Unarmored**: Characters who wear no armor benefit from a baseline dodge bonus to AC, equal to [3 + 1/3 the character's ranks in Acrobatics]. This bonus applies against touch attacks, but not when you are flat-footed or otherwise denied your Dexterity bonus to AC. This bonus does not stack with armor bonuses to AC.
* **Light**: Characters who wear light armor gain no special benefits.
* **Medium**: Characters who wear medium armor gain no special benefits.
* **Heavy**: Characters who wear heavy armor do not add a Dexterity bonus or penalty to their AC, cannot be flanked, and are never treated as if they have lost their Dexterity bonus to AC.

### Armor/Shield Bonus

Each type of armor grants an armor bonus to Armor Class, while shields grant a shield bonus to Armor Class. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn’t stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn’t stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.

### Maximum Dex Bonus

This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class that this type of armor allows. Dexterity bonuses in excess of this number are reduced to this number for the purposes of determining the wearer’s Armor Class. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer’s ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn’t affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.

Even if a character’s Dex bonus to Armor Class drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing his Dex bonus to Armor Class.

A character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also restrict the maximum Dex bonus that can be applied to his Armor Class.

### Armor Check Penalty

Any armor heavier than leather, as well as any shield, hurts a character’s ability to use Dex and Str-based skills. An armor check penalty applies to all Dex and Str-based skill checks. A character’s encumbrance may also incur an armor check penalty.

**Shields:** If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.

**Nonproficient with Armor Worn:** A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he is not proficient takes the armor’s (and/or shield’s) armor check penalty on attack rolls as well as on all Dex– and Str-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for non-proficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for shields.

**Sleeping in Armor:** A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He takes a –2 penalty on Str and Dex and can’t charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.

### Speed

Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on Table: Armor and Shields is the character’s speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet. They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf’s land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

Shields: Shields do not affect a character’s speed.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor

Putting on or taking off armor is a sometimes complicated procedure. The time required to don armor depends on its type.

**Light**: Light armor takes 1 minute to put on or remove. The time to remove light armor may be halved with the help of another character. It may be donned hastily in half the time, increasing the armor check penalty by 1 and reducing the armor bonus by 1.

**Medium**: Medium armor takes 4 minutes to put on and 1 minute to remove. These times may be halved with the help of another character. It may be donned hastily in 1 minute, increasing the armor check penalty by 1 and reducing the armor bonus by 1.

**Heavy**: Heavy armor may only be put on with the help of another character, and takes 4 minutes to do so. It may be removed alone in 4 minutes, or removed in 2 minutes with help. It may be donned hastily alone in 4 minutes, or with help in 2 minutes, increasing the armor check penalty by 2 and reducing the armor bonus by 2.
