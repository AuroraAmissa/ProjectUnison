# Weapons

Without a doubt, weapons number among adventurers’ most coveted possessions. Whether weapons are used as tools to lay foul monsters low, or as outlets for a host of fundamental class abilities, few heroes head into the field without their favorite—or perhaps even a whole arsenal of their favorites. This section presents all manner of weapons for PCs to purchase and put to use, whatever their adventures might entail. The weapons presented here should be relatively easy to find and purchase in most towns and cities, although GMs might wish to restrict the availability of some of the more expensive and exotic items.

All weapons deal hit point damage. This damage is subtracted from the current hit points of any creature struck by the weapon. When the result of the die roll to make an attack is a natural 20 (that is, the die actually shows a 20), this is known as a critical threat (although some weapons can score a critical threat on a roll of less than 20). If a critical threat is scored, another attack roll is made, using the same modifiers as the original attack roll. If this second attack roll exceeds the target’s AC, the hit becomes a critical hit, dealing additional damage.

Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon’s use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon’s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), its size (Small, Medium, or Large), and its general group (e.g. close, light blade, or thrown).

## Mechanics

### Weapon Groups

All weapons are categorized into one or more of 10 weapon groups:

* **Archery** weapons include all projectile weapons that use bowstrings, such as bows and crossbows.
* **Axes**, include waraxes, handaxes and other weapons of a similar shape such as picks.
* **Heavy blades** include Heavier bladed weapons such as longswords or katana.
* **Light blades** include lighter bladed weapons such as daggers or rapiers.
* **Blunt** weapons include those that deal damage through sheer mass such as maces and warhammers.
* **Close Combat** weapons include those used in hand-to-hand combat such as shields, tonfa, or knuckles.
* **Firearms** weapons include all guns and any weapon that operates similarly to such.
* **Flails** include flexible weapons such as whips and morningstars.
* **Polearms** include weapons on poles that can be used at longer ranges, such as spears and naginata.
* **Thrown** weapons include those that can be used by throwing, such as chakram, daggers, or darts.

Additionally, some special weapons are categorized into one of 3 special groups. Any abilities that grant characters the ability to use such weapons also grants them proficiency with them. As such, these groups are generally only used for feats such as Weapon Focus, rather than being important for proficiencies: 

* **Ephemeral** weapons are those created out of fire, light, or other similar formless energies.
* **Natural** weapons are those that are innately part of the user's body, such as fists, claws or teeth.
* **Ray** weapons are magical spells and energy blasts that are directed created targeting an enemy.

### Proficiencies

All weapons are considered simple, martial or exotic. Characters are proficient with all simple weapons. When a character gains a combat tradition, they can gain proficiency in all martial weapons in a specific weapon group. In place of gaining proficiency with a weapon group, a character may instead gain proficiency in an exotic weapon of a group they already have proficiency in.

A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon.

### Weapon Range

Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.

* **Melee Weapons:** A melee weapon allows the wielder to strike targets in their natural reach. Light melee weapons use the higher of the user's Strength and Dexterity modifiers to hit, and the user's Strength modifier for damage. 1H and 2H melee weapons use the user's Strength modifier both to hit and for damage.

* **Reach Weapons:** A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike targets within double their natural reach. However, they cannot strike targets within their usual natural reach. Hence, Medium wielders may strike creatures between 5 and 10 feet away and Large creatures may strike creatures between 10 and 20 feet away.

* **Ranged Weapons:** Most ranged weapons require two hands to use. Ranged weapons use their wielder's Dexterity modifier to hit. A character gets no Strength bonus or penalty on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it has the muscle or power special features.

* **Thrown Weapons:** Certain weapons are design to be thrown. Thrown weapons may be used as either a melee weapon or a ranged weapon. Throwing a light or 1H weapon requires 2 Acts, while throwing a 2H weapon requires 3 Acts. While you can throw melee weapons that aren't designed for throwing, using them in such a way reduces their damage dice by one step, their critical threat range to "×2", and causes you to roll the attack as if you were nonproficient in the weapon.

* **Ammunition:** Projectile weapons use ammunition. When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost. Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and what happens to them after they are thrown.

### Weapon Class

This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon’s size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.

* **Light:** A light weapon is easily wielded in one hand, even by physically weaker characters. A character using a light weapon may always choose to add their Dexterity bonus in place of their Strength bonus when rolling to hit. Add the wielder's Strength modifier when a light weapon is used in the primary hand and half the wielder's Strength modifier when it is used in the off-hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no specific advantage.

* **One-Handed:** A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls.

* **Two-Handed:** Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.

### Weapon Size

Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.

A weapon’s size category isn’t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon’s size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.

> #### Inappropriately Sized Weapons
> 
> A creature can’t make optimum use of a weapon that isn’t properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn’t proficient with the weapon, a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.
> 
> The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder’s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. For example, a Small creature would wield a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon. If a weapon’s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can’t wield the weapon at all.

### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

### Weapon Statistics

All weapons have several statistics that determine how they function in combat:

* **Dmg:** The damage the weapon deals. The stated damage is for when the weapon is wielded by a medium sized creature. Decrease the damage dice by one step for each size smaller than Medium the creature is, or increase it by one step for each size larger than Medium the character is. If the dice value goes below 1, the weapon is too small to function.

* **Crit:** This entry notes how the weapon functions with the rules for critical hits. A number range such as "19-20" means the weapon threatens a critical hit if the roll is 19 or higher, or whatever the lower number is. A multiplier such as "×2" or "×3" means to multiply the damage dealt by the weapon by 2 or 3 on a critical hit. These numbers are often written together with a slash between them, such as "19-20/×3". "—" means the weapon cannot threaten critical hits.

* **Range:** Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a –4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot to 10 range increments.

* **Type:** Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some characters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons. Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; all damage caused is of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon. In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.

> #### Damage Dice Steps
> 
> When you increase or decrease a damage dice by a step, use the next or previous value in the following list: [1]{.c}, [1d2]{.c}, [1d3]{.c}, [1d4]{.c}, [1d6]{.c}, [1d8]{.c}, [1d10]{.c}, [2d6]{.c}, [2d8]{.c}, [3d6]{.c}, [3d8]{.c}, [4d6]{.c}, [4d8]{.c}, [6d6]{.c}, [6d8]{.c}, [8d6]{.c}, [8d8]{.c}, [12d6]{.c}, [12d8]{.c}, [16d6]{.c}

### Special Features

Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions. Special features marked with a (\*) may only be applied if you are proficient with the weapon.

* **Agile (\*):** The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack is reduced by 1, and by 2 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

* **Ammo:** A thrown weapon with the ammo special feature is only useful as a thrown weapon. It counts as an improvised weapon with damage dice that is one step lower when used as a melee weapon. For purposes of crafting, purchasing them, or retrieving them after being fired, they count as ammunition instead of weapons.

* **Blocking (\*):** When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC and reduce the penalty on attack rolls to -2. Some weapons may specify a higher bonus to AC such as "blocking (+2)".

* **Brace (\*):** If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging creature.

* **Breach (\*):** If you use a breach weapon to attack an object, you ignore a certain amount of its hardness. For example "breach 2" means to ignore 2 hardness when attacking an object.

* **Brawling (\*):** A brawling weapon is used like normal close combat martial arts. You may use any abilities you could normally use with an unarmed strike with a brawling weapon instead.

* **Concealable:** You get a +2 bonus on Finesse skill checks and DCs made to conceal a concealable weapon on your body. Some weapons may specify a higher bonus such as "concealable (+4)".

* **Crush (\*):** When used to attack an enemy wearing heavy armor, reduce their armor bonus to AC by 2 while calculating whether this weapon hits. The same applies when attacking an enemy wearing medium armor, but this only reduces the armor bonus by 1. Some weapons may specify a higher amount of AC ignored, which only applies to heavy armor such as "crush 3".

* **Disarm (\*):** When you use a disarm weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to disarm an enemy. Some weapons may specify a higher bonus.

* **Distracting (\*):** You gain a +2 bonus on Deception skill checks to feint in combat while wielding this weapon. Some weapons may specify a higher bonus.

* **Double:** You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

* **Fearsome (\*):** You gain a +2 bonus on Influence skill checks to intimidate in combat while wielding this weapon. Some weapons may specify a higher bonus.

* **Finesse:** You may apply your Dexterity modifier to hit with this weapon, as if it were a Light weapon.

* **Harrying (\*):** You gain a +2 bonus on skill checks to antagonize in while wielding this weapon. Some weapons may specify a higher bonus. 

* **Muscle:** Some ranged weapons depend on the strength of the wielder to deliver the proper power. If you have a negative Strength modifier, apply it to your damage with this weapon.

* **Nonlethal:** These weapons deal nonlethal damage.

* **Overpower (\*):** You ignore any dodge bonus to AC from fighting defensively. When used to attack an enemy with a shield bonus to AC, reduce it by 2 while calculating whether this weapon hits. Some weapons may specify a higher amount of AC ignored.

* **Pierce:** When used to attack an enemy with an armor bonus to AC, reduce it by 1 while calculating whether this weapon hits. Some weapons may specify a higher amount of AC ignored.

* **Precision:** You must apply your Dexterity modifier to damage in place of your Strength modifier. Additionally, when you use this weapon to deliver a coup de grâce, it deals 3 additional damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit.

* **Power:** The power tag functions identically to the muscle tag, except the wielder adds their Strength bonus to damage if they have one.

* **Reload:** This weapon cannot be loaded as part of firing it, and an additional action must be taken to load it.

* **Sunder (\*):** When you use a sunder weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to sunder attempts. Some weapons may specify a higher bonus.

* **Trip (\*):** When you use a trip weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to trip attempts. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped. Some weapons may specify a higher bonus.
