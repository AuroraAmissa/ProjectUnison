# Weapons

Without a doubt, weapons number among adventurers’ most coveted possessions. Whether weapons are used as tools to lay foul monsters low, or as outlets for a host of fundamental class abilities, few heroes head into the field without their favorite—or perhaps even a whole arsenal of their favorites. This section presents all manner of weapons for PCs to purchase and put to use, whatever their adventures might entail. The weapons presented here should be relatively easy to find and purchase in most towns and cities, although GMs might wish to restrict the availability of some of the more expensive and exotic items.

All weapons deal hit point damage. This damage is subtracted from the current hit points of any creature struck by the weapon. When the result of the die roll to make an attack is a natural 20 (that is, the die actually shows a 20), this is known as a critical threat (although some weapons can score a critical threat on a roll of less than 20). If a critical threat is scored, another attack roll is made, using the same modifiers as the original attack roll. If this second attack roll exceeds the target’s AC, the hit becomes a critical hit, dealing additional damage.

Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon’s use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon’s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), its size (Small, Medium, or Large), and its general group (e.g. close, light blade, or thrown).

## Mechanics

### Weapon Groups

All weapons are categorized into one or more of 10 weapon groups:

* **Archery** weapons include all projectile weapons that use bowstrings, such as bows and crossbows.
* **Axes**, include waraxes, handaxes and other weapons of a similar shape such as picks.
* **Heavy blades** include Heavier bladed weapons such as longswords or katana.
* **Light blades** include lighter bladed weapons such as daggers or rapiers.
* **Blunt** weapons include those that deal damage through sheer mass such as maces and warhammers.
* **Close Combat** weapons include those used in hand-to-hand combat such as shields, tonfa, or knuckles.
* **Firearms** weapons include all guns and any weapon that operates similarly to such.
* **Flails** include flexible weapons such as whips and morningstars.
* **Polearms** include weapons on poles that can be used at longer ranges, such as spears and naginata.
* **Thrown** weapons include those that can be used by throwing, such as chakram, daggers, or darts.

Additionally, some special weapons are categorized into one of 3 special groups. Any abilities that grant characters the ability to use such weapons also grants them proficiency with them. As such, these groups are generally only used for feats such as Weapon Focus, rather than being important for proficiencies: 

* **Ephemeral** weapons are those created out of fire, light, or other similar formless energies.
* **Natural** weapons are those that are innately part of the user's body, such as fists, claws or teeth.
* **Ray** weapons are magical spells and energy blasts that are directed created targeting an enemy.

### Proficiencies

All weapons are considered simple, martial or exotic. Characters are proficient with all simple weapons. When a character gains a combat tradition, they can gain proficiency in all martial weapons in a specific weapon group. In place of gaining proficiency with a weapon group, a character may instead gain proficiency in an exotic weapon of a group they already have proficiency in.

A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon.

### Weapon Range

Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.

* **Reach Weapons:** A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren’t adjacent to him. Most reach weapons double the wielder’s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.

* **Thrown Weapons:** The wielder applies their Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons. It is possible to throw a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown, and a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

* **Projectile Weapons:** Most projectile weapons require two hands to use. A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it’s a specially built composite shortbow or longbow, or a sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when they use a bow or a sling.

* **Ammunition:** Projectile weapons use ammunition. When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost. Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and what happens to them after they are thrown.

### Weapon Class

This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon’s size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.

* **Light:** A light weapon is easily wielded in one hand, even by physically weaker characters. A character using a light weapon may always choose to add their Dexterity bonus in place of their Strength bonus when rolling to hit. Add the wielder's Strength modifier when a light weapon is used in the primary hand and half the wielder's Strength modifier when it is used in the off-hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no specific advantage.

* **One-Handed:**  A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls.

* **Two-Handed:** Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.

### Weapon Size

Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.

A weapon’s size category isn’t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon’s size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.

> #### Inappropriately Sized Weapons
> 
> A creature can’t make optimum use of a weapon that isn’t properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn’t proficient with the weapon, a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.
> 
> The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder’s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. For example, a Small creature would wield a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon. If a weapon’s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can’t wield the weapon at all.

### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

### Weapon Statistics

All weapons have several statistics that determine how they function in combat:

* **Dmg:** The damage the weapon deals. The stated damage is for when the weapon is wielded by a medium sized creature. Decrease the damage dice by one step for each size smaller than Medium the creature is, or increase it by one step for each size larger than Medium the character is. If the dice value goes below 1, the weapon is too small to function.

* **Crit:** This entry notes how the weapon functions with the rules for critical hits. A number range such as "19-20" means the weapon threatens a critical hit if the roll is 19 or higher, or whatever the lower number is. A multiplier such as "×2" or "×3" means to multiply the damage dealt by the weapon by 2 or 3 on a critical hit. These numbers are often written together with a slash between them, such as "19-20/×3".

* **Range:** Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a –4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot to 10 range increments.

* **Type:** Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some characters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons. Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; all damage caused is of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon. In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.

#### Damage Dice Steps

When you increase or decrease a damage dice by a step, use the next or previous value in the following list: 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 2d6, 2d8, 3d6, 3d8, 4d6, 4d8, 6d6, 6d8, 8d6, 8d8, 12d6, 12d8, 16d6

### Special Features

Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions.

* **Blocking:** When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.

* **Brace:** If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging creature.

* **Brawling:** A brawling weapon is used like normal close combat martial arts. You may use any abilities you could normally use with an unarmed strike with a brawling weapon instead.

* **Concealable:** You get a +2 bonus on Subterfuge skill checks made to conceal a concealable weapon on your body. Some weapons may specify a higher concealment bonus with a propertly like "concealable (+4)".

* **Deadly:** When you use this weapon to deliver a coup de grace, it gains a +4 bonus to damage when calculating the DC of the Fortitude saving throw to see whether the target of the coup de grace dies from the attack. The bonus is not added to the actual damage of the coup de grace attack.

* **Disarm:** When you use a disarm weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to disarm an enemy.

* **Distracting:** You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff skill checks to feint in combat while wielding this weapon.

* **Double:** You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

* **Fragile:** Weapons and armor with the fragile quality cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead. Masterwork and magical fragile weapons and armor lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description or the special material description. If a weapon gains the broken condition in this way, that weapon is considered to have taken damage equal to half its hit points +1. This damage is repaired either by something that addresses the effect that granted the weapon the broken condition (like quick clear in the case of firearm misfires or the Field Repair feat) or by the repair methods described in the broken condition. When an effect that grants the broken condition is removed, the weapon regains the hit points it lost when the broken condition was applied. Damage done by an attack against a weapon (such as from a sunder combat maneuver) cannot be repaired by an effect that removes the broken condition. Source: PRG:UC.

* **Grapple:** On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can grapple the target of the attack. The wielder can then attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple his opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you. While you grapple the target with a grappling weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered grappled, though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the grapple. If you move far enough away to be out of the weapon’s reach, you end the grapple with that action. Source: PRG:UC.

* **Nonlethal:** These weapons deal nonlethal damage.

* **Performance:** When wielding this weapon, if an attack or combat maneuver made with this weapon prompts a combat performance check, you gain a +2 bonus on that check.

* **Reach:** You use a reach weapon to strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.

* **Strength (#):** This feature is usually only applied to ranged weapons (such as composite bows). Some weapons function better in the hands of stronger users. All such weapons are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency and this number is included in parenthesis). If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the weapon, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. For example, the default (lowest form of) composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A weapon with the Strength feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow. Editor’s Note: The “Strength” weapon feature was ‘created’ by d20pfsrd.com as a shorthand note to the composite bow mechanics. This is not “Paizo” or “official” content.

* **Sunder:** When you use a sunder weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to sunder attempts.

* **Trip:** You can use a trip weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.
