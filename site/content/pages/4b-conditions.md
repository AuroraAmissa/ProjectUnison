# Conditions

Characters may often gain temporary conditions during combat or exploration, representing various forms of temporary harm inflicted upon them. If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If effects canâ€™t combine, apply the most severe effect.

## Conditions List

#### Encumbered

While encumbered, you reduce each of your movement speeds by 10 feet, reduce your maximum Dexterity bonus to AC to +2, and take a -5 penalty to Strength- and Dexterity-based checks.

#### Overburdened

If you have the overburdened condition, you reduce each of your movement speeds to 5 feet, reduce your maximum Dexterity bonus to AC to +0, and take a -5 penalty to Strength- and Dexterity-based checks.
