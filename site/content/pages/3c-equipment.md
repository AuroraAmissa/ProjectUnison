# Equipment

To make your mark on the world, you'll need to have the right equipment, including armor, weapons, and other gear. This chapter presents a list of equipment your character may use, and rules for how they work.

Characters begin with a selection of equipment whose maintenance cost does not exceed their maintenance cap for their resources level.

## Carrying Capacity

These carrying capacity rules determine how much your character's equipment slows you down. Carrying capacity is based on the bulk of items, which accounts for both their weight and their unwieldiness.

### Item Bulk

Each item in this chapter has a representation of its bulk, which is a number, the letter "L" if it has light bulk, or a dash ("—") if it has negligible bulk.

Every 10 items that have light bulk count as 1 bulk, and fractions don't count—so 10 items with light bulk have a total of 1 bulk, and 19 such items also have a total of 1 bulk. Items that have negligible bulk count toward your bulk limit only if the GM determines that you are carrying an unreasonable number of them.

Add together the numerical bulk values of all items you are wearing and carrying to determine the total amount of bulk you are carrying.

### Bulk Limits

You can carry an amount of bulk up to half your Strength score without difficulty. If you carry more than that, you gain the [Encumbered](Conditions#) condition, until the amount of bulk you carry becomes less than or equal to half your Strength score. You can't voluntarily wear or hold an amount of bulk that is greater than your Strength score. If you are forced to do so (due to changing gravity, for example), you gain the [Overburdened](Conditions#) condition, until the bulk you carry becomes less than or equal to your Strength score.

If you are wearing armor, use the worse penalty (from armor or bulk) for speed adjustments and skill checks. The penalties do not stack.

### Estimating Bulk

As a general rule, an item that weighs around 5 to 10 pounds is 1 bulk (and every multiple of 10 is an additional bulk), an item weighing a few ounces is negligible, and anything in between is light. An awkward or unwieldy item might have a higher bulk.

## Resources and Maintenance

In addition to their bulk, items have a cost that represents the financial burden of obtaining and maintaining that equipment. These costs have the same format as Bulk, with "L" representing trivial cost and a dash ("—") representing negligible cost.

### Resources Level

Your character's resources level represents their general level of wealth. All characters begin with a base resources level of 1, and may gain additional levels through the [Resources](Bonus Points#Resources Bonus Trait) bonus trait and some talents.

A character may purchase new equipment with a cost up their purchase cap during each downtime, and may maintain equipment with a cost up their maintenance cap each downtime.

If they cannot pay the cost to maintain their equipment, it gains the [Broken](Conditions#) condition. If they cannot pay the cost to maintain broken equipment, it becomes unusable and cannot be economically repaired. Fixing broken equipment requires twice the usual maintenance cap be spent to restore it. Holdings such as businesses or land are simply lost, and cannot be repaired or unbroken.

Any resources from a character's purchase cap that they don't spend during a downtime cycle is saved, and may be spent in future cycles, up to a cap of their maintenance cap. For easier tracking, these savings are rounded down to the nearest resource point if you have a resources level of 2 or higher.

| Resources Level           | Purchase Cap | Maintenance Cap |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 0 (Poverty)               | —            | L               |
| 1 (Laborer)               | L            | 1               |
| 2 (Skilled Laborer)       | 1            | 5               |
| 3 (Low-Ranking Official)  | 5            | 25              |
| 4 (High-Ranking Official) | 15           | 120             |
| 5 (Low-Ranking Nobility)  | 60           | 600             |
| 6 (High-Ranking Nobility) | 250          | 3000            |
| 7 (Monarch)               | 1000         | 15000           |

**Note:** Resource levels for lower class characters in medieval settings often represents skills and resources available for barter rather than currency. As such, resource points are an abstract measure of value and purchasing power with no direct conversion to currency. For more advanced settings where currency is used universally, see the chapter on [Modern Settings](#Resources).

### Multiple Income Sources

Characters often gain multiple income sources over the course of a campaign, whether innately through their own skills, fortuitously through finding treasure in their explorations, or externally through the support of rich patrons throughout their adventures. A character's total resource level is always equal to the highest one among their income sources.

One-time windfalls such as a stash of treasure in a dungeon or selling a valuable magic item only provide a temporary income source for one downtime cycle. Your character may choose to spend such income slower, doubling the duration that they benefit from it for each level they reduce the income by.

### Providing Income to Others

Particularly rich characters may be able to provide income to other characters without significantly impacting their own lives.

For this purpose, a character may provide the entirety of one of their income sources to another character, or divide an income source into 4 income sources with a resources level one lower than its current one. They may choose to benefit from one of these, if they have done this to their largest income source.

> #### Gamemastering Note
>
> This rule is meant for social-centered campaigns where the financial situation of characters and the social weight that carries is more central to the storyline. For more standard campaigns centered on exploration, combat or dungeons, consider forbidding the use of this rule. This reduces the need to track individual income sources for characters.
