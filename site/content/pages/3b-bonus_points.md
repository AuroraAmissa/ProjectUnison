# Bonus Points

Your character gains 5 bonus points each level (including the first), which may be spent to buy bonus traits. Each bonus trait has multiple levels, granting increasing benefits the more levels you ahve of the trait. To gain a new bonus trait or increase a level of a bonus trait, you spend bonus points equal to its cost per level.

The "**Mins**:" section of each bonus trait tells you how many levels of a bonus trait you may take, and at what levels. A bonus trait with 3 levels will have 3 numbers seperated by the character "/", one with 5 levels will have 5 numbers, and so on. The number tells you the minimum character level you can buy that level at. For example, "1/3/5" means a bonus trait that has 3 levels, which may be taken at 1st level for the first level, 3rd for the second, and 5th for the third.

Some bonus traits have a Mins section that ends with a number like "+1". This means that it may be taken any number of times, one per level. For example, "1/+2" means the trait can be taken once at first level, a second time at third, and so on. "1/+1" means one level of the trait may be taken each character level.

The "**Cost**:" section of each bonus trait tells you how many bonus points the bonus trait costs per level.

Some bonus traits allow you to take multiple instances of them. This allows you to gain the bonus traits multiple times. When you have multiple instances of the same trait, you must increase your level in the instances seperately -- for all intents and purposes they are treated as two seperate traits.
